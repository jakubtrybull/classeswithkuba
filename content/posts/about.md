### Hello!
My name is Jakub Trybull, but everybody calls me Kuba.


I am a recent graduate from the **University of Oxford** in BA Economics and Management.
Then after a year's language immersion in Paris, I am enrolled in research Masters in Sociology at the *Ã‰cole des Hautes Ã‰tudes en Sciences Sociales* (EHESS).

Before Oxford, I had the privilege of studying a variety of beloved courses as part of the *International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme*. I focused on Maths, Physics and Economics, alongside studying French, English Literature and Theatre. As you might be able to tell, I am a generalist and interested in inter-disciplinary studies!

Teaching is important to me coming from a low-income background. At school, I was a mathematics tutor for fellow classmates and lower years. At university, I enrolled into the TrinityCERT TEFL programme where I taught English to large classes.

I have been tutoring since 2022 and provide high-quality engaging sessions in *Economics, Mathematics, English as a Foreign Language,* and *University Admission mentoring*.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, drawing and hiking.
