**Do you offer online tutoring?**

**How do I book a session?**

>You can contact me directly through the Contact page and click the link to schedule a free consultation.


**What is your cancellation or rescheduling policy?**

>Please give at least 24 hours’ notice for cancellations or rescheduling. This allows time to accommodate other students (and my own studies!). Any shorter notice remains chargeable.

**Do you provide study materials?**

**How long are sessions?**

>Standard sessions are 60 minutes, but longer or shorter sessions can be arranged based on your needs.
